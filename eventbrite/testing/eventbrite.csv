FARSA MONEDA CONCERT,"This is a special event organised in conjunction with 
TUNEDIN.LONDON 
 ""FARSA MONEDA"" 
 27th January, 7.45 pm (doors 7.15 pm) 
Traditional Spanish Coplas form a genre that reflects the passions and dreams of the Spanish people in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, a heartwrenching and divisive time that came to an end in 1939, and was followed by the long dictatorship under Franco. Farsa Moneda bring alive these songs with a vibrancy and desire to tell the tales contained within them. Well known in Spain, coplas are less so abroad. Through the beautiful sound of the guitar, profound and powerful vocals and many different Latin percussion instruments, Farsa Moneda offer a very personal and contemporary approach to Spanish and Latin traditional music.  

 Farsa Moneda are: Violeta García (voice & violin), Pablo Dominguez (guitar & percussion), and Maria Camahort (guitar).  Performances have included festivals such as City of London Festival and London Classical Guitar Festival, and venues such as Bolívar Hall, The Forge, Ronnie Scott's Upstairs and Bishopsgate Institute.  

Included in your ticket: tea or coffee.    There is no bar at Sands Films Studio but The Mayflower Pub is across the road and the Ship is 3 minutes away...  Rotherhithe Station is just a 2 min walk away.

DE FUEGO CONCERT,"This is a special event organised in conjunction with 
TUNEDIN.LONDON 
 ""DE FUEGO"" 
 10th Febuary, 7.45 pm (doors 7.15 pm) 
  

  
Sensational guitar duo, De Fuego, play energetic instrumental flamenco- and rumba-based music. From their humble beginnings busking and (much followed) youtube guitar tutoring, the duo has gone on to impress at many an English and European summer festival (Glastonbury, Shambala, Secret Garden Party, Sziget, Meadows in the Mountains & more) with their upbeat passionate sounds and percussive guitar techniques. No cajon needed for this pair with a style all of their own, playing largely their own compositions.  
  
""De Fuego are just something else. Totally humble and unassuming as individuals, but don’t let this deceive you! From the second the first pluck hits the airwaves you’re swept away with their passion"" efestivals.co.uk 
  
 
  
De Fuego is made up of Hungarian guitarist Edina Balczo and Spanish guitarist Marc Rodriguez Alvarez, who has taken up the baton from founding musician Davide Lufrano Chaves, who very sadly lost a courageous battle to Multiple Myeloma in 2013. Marc brings his exciting and melodic guitar playing along side Edina's percussive and rhythmic guitar techniques to continue the journey. ""Edina's rhythm is spot on, steady and punchy, and Mark's lead is both fluid and crisp."" Fatea Magazine 
  
 
  
They have recently released De Fuego's second album, Davide thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. 
  
 
  
This event is a prelude to the Rotherhithe Arts Festival SEE16 organised by IliveinSE16.com, running from 11th-14th February 2016.

For two continuous weeks in October 2015, the Saharawi refugee camps (SW Algeria) suffered the worst torrential rains in ther 40 years of history.

The line-up of some of London’s leading talents performing on the evening include Pia de Keyser, singer-songwriter and actress, who recorded her songs in February 2015 in the Saharawi refugee camps; Ramon Goose, one of the most versatile blues artists of his generation, with his World Scatterlings band; Renny Jackson and his band, whose 2007 trip to the camps inspired the beautiful “Free Western Sahara” song; poet Sam Berkson, in collaboration with Algerian darbuka player Karim Dellali, will recite poems from Settled Wanderers: The Poetry of Western Sahara - the first ever English translation of Saharawi poetry; and Grupo Lokito, the best of Cuban-Congolese fusion, led by pianist and sound engineer Sara McGuinness. DJ Jamie Renton will be interlacing the evening with his irresistible global tunes.

"Passion, Preludes and Pianos with Rose Cholmondeley and Charles Grant","PASSION, PRELUDES AND PIANOS 
Chopin and the writer George Sand (Baroness Dudevant) began an affair in the summer of 1838. In order to escape a former lover of hers, and also for the sake of Chopin’s health, they went for a winter holiday to Majorca. It was not a good choice as it was damp and rainy much of the time and the locals – hearing Chopin coughing – thought he had TB and refused to rent them rooms. They were forced to decamp with George’s two children and a maid to a disused monastery, called Valldemossa, in the hills. Here he was to compose some of his finest music.   
Programme includes: CHOPIN Ballade No.2, Scherzo No.3, Polonaises Nos. 3 & 4, a Mazurka and a selection of Preludes 
 
Rose Cholmondely - piano 
ROSE CHOLMONDELEY has given recitals in London at the Purcell Room and Wigmore Hall, the Polish Embassy, Polish Institute, French Institute and Leighton House. She has toured India and given recitals in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. Her interest in the music of Chopin often takes her to Poland, where she has toured the country several times, also giving recitals at Chopin’s birthplace, Zelazowa Wola, and the Ostrogski Castle, home of the Chopin Museum in Warsaw, the Sandomierz Festival and the prestigious Antonin Chopin Festival. She has also performed Chopin’s E minor piano concerto in Krakow with the Krakow Philharmonic Orchestra under Jerzy Maksymiuk. ‘Passion, Preludes and Pianos’ has been performed at Valldemosa celebrating the 175th anniversary of Chopin and George Sand’s arrival on Majorca. 
“Balancing improvisatory freedom and classical restraint, Cholmondeley is splendid” Hi-Fi News 
 
Charles Grant - narrator 
CHARLES GRANT trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and has appeared in the theatre in a dazzling variety of plays and musicals, ranging from Restoration comedy, through Noël Coward to Andrew Lloyd Webber. He has also done a great deal of radio work and made many recordings. Charles is a Trustee of Iris Theatre and is Concert Director at “The Actors’ Church”, St. Paul’s Covent Garden. ",http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/passion-preludes-and-pianos-with-rose-cholmondeley-and-charles-grant-tickets-18616979888?aff=ebapi,2016-01-23T19:30:00,2016-01-23T21:15:00
